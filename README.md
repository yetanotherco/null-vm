# Null VM

Verifiable VM made in collaboration with [Lambdaclass](https://lambdaclass.com/) and [3MI Labs](https://www.3milabs.tech/)

Non-null name TBD

We are developing an open-source verifiable virtual machine that allows users to prove the correctness of the execution of a given program with an input stream.

Right now, this is a project under development and experimentation and must not be used in production!

## Design choices

- The Instruction Set Architecture is RISCV64IM
- The proof system is transparent (no trusted setup) and post-quantum secure (hash-based)
- The security is over 100 bits of security
- The codebase of the whole project must be simple and minimalistic

## Design principles

Following [ethrex](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex):
- Ensure effortless setup and execution across all target environments.
- Be vertically integrated. Have the minimal amount of dependencies.
- Have a simple type system. Avoid generics leaking over the codebase.
- Have few abstractions. Do not generalize until you absolutely need it. Repeating code two or three times can be fine.
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability over premature optimizations.

## Roadmap

This project is under active development. Our primary objective is to have a first working version for the virtual machine. The first roadmap for the project can be found [here](./docs/roadmap.md). Priorities and features might change as we continue developing.

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found in [docs](./docs/). It is currently a work in progress, we expect that as more features and components become ready, they will be included in the docs.

## Testing

### ASM Tests

In order to add a new asm test you should add the `.s` file under `programs/asm`
Then add the corresponding test under `tests/asm.rs`

To run them you can use

`make test`

This will compile them and run the tests

### Rust Tests

In order to add a new rust test you should add the cargo project under `programs/rust` as a new directory.
The folder should have the same name as the `Cargo.toml` program name.
Then add the corresponding test under `tests/rust.rs`

You can run it with

`make test`

## Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the contributions made by various teams who developed the core cryptographic primitives and designs and we have learnt and drawn inspiration from them.
